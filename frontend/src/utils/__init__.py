// frontend/src/utils/__init__.py is an empty file as it serves as an initializer for Python packages.
// However, since we are working within a JavaScript/React project structure, this file is not needed.
// JavaScript does not use __init__.py files. Instead, it uses index.js files to export modules from a directory.
// Therefore, no code is needed in this file, and it can be safely deleted from the project structure.
