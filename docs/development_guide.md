# Olvy Development Guide

Welcome to the Olvy Development Guide. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers working on the Olvy platform, specifically focusing on the Customer Survey Tool feature. Below you will find instructions and standards to follow when contributing to the codebase.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git (for version control)

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/olvy.git
cd olvy
```

## Backend Development

### Setting Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Database Configuration

Set up the database by running the setup script:

```bash
python scripts/setup_database.py
```

### Running the Server

Start the backend server:

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

### Writing Code

When adding new features or fixing bugs, adhere to the following:

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all new code in the `tests/backend` directory.
- Document functions and classes using docstrings.

## Frontend Development

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

### Writing Code

For frontend contributions, keep in mind:

- Follow the AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide.
- Use React functional components with hooks.
- Ensure responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Write tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library in the `tests/frontend` directory.

## Integration with Third-Party Services

To integrate with services like Carta, CRM, or OpenAI, use the scripts in the `integration` directory. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.

## Version Control

We use Git for version control. Follow these best practices:

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Commit small, logical chunks with descriptive commit messages.
- Rebase frequently to keep up with changes in the main branch.
- Open a pull request and request a code review from a team member.

## Code Reviews

Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality. When reviewing code, check for:

- Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Proper error handling and input validation.
- Performance optimizations.
- Security vulnerabilities.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, use the provided deployment script:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_application.sh
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the deployment environment.

## Documentation

Update the API documentation and user manuals with any changes to the codebase. Use Markdown for all documentation in the `docs` directory.

## Conclusion

Thank you for contributing to Olvy. By following these guidelines, we can ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Happy coding!
